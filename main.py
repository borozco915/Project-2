#This includes driver strategies, track-specific adaptations, and team dynamics.

"""
INSIGHT PARAGRAPH:

This project gave me a deeper appreciation of consistency and dominance in F1 history. 
Especially since a lot of my favorite F1 drivers are Ayton Senna, Michael Schumacher, and currently Carlos Sainz
By creating a 'Legendary' metric based on winning 3+ championships, I identified which 
drivers dominated their eras. I was surprised to see that some drivers with fewer championships 
had higher win rates than multi-title holdersâ€”highlighting how context and competition 
affect legacy.

As an F1 fan, this project relates directly to my passion. It helped me back up discussions 
with actual data, and made me think more critically about what defines greatness in motorsport. 
One challenge was handling missing values for older drivers due to incomplete data.

AI Tools Used:

Tool: ChatGpt
-How it was used: I used ChatGPT to give me an example for a generic idea of what type of category 
could be used in the dataset. Which is why it gave my the "legendary" which after that, I used to give
a generic idea of what type of code to write for tracking that data. I used to check if anything could be improved
in my code or if the outputs would be correct before I ran it.
